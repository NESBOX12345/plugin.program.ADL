## Installing the latest development version ##

It is important that you follow this instructions or Advanced DOOM Launcher won't work well.

  1) In this page click on the green button `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`

  2) Uncompress this ZIP file. This will create a folder named `plugin.program.advanced.DOOM.launcher-master`

  3) Rename that folder to `plugin.program.advanced.DOOM.launcher`

  4) Compress that folder again into a ZIP file. 

  5) In Kodi, use that ZIP file (and not the original one) to install the plugin in 
     `System` --> `Addons` --> `Install from ZIP file`.

  6) Enjoy!
